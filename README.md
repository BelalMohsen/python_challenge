# Welcome!

Hello, and welcome to my work log.

This git repo is dedicated to document and keep track of the current work.
This work is what is associated with what I have accomplished in [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

My day-to-day log, can you find [here!](/daily_log.md)

For [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge, so will I use these resources:

- [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse/)
- [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)

To find out more about the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge, go to [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

## What do I want to accomplish?

The end goal is to learn more of python and complete the tasks and challenges in the crash course book.

Also, alongside going through the book, I want to relearn and continue development skills in programming.

If I complete the book before the end of the hundred days, so will I continue exploring django and web related skills.
