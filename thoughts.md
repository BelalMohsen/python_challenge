# Thoughts

This document will be used to write down ideas or challenges for next round of 100 days of code.

## Next round

This will be a list with short keywords and some description for what I may pursue in the next round.

Keyword | Description
--- | ---
cs50 | I have been watching CS50 lecture videos. In these videos, so have they been discussing different topics which grants great insight for problem solving. They have course material accessible for anyone to partake in at EdX. In my next round, I may consider doing the course at edx to reaffirm my theoretical knowledge.
front-end | I want to practice my skills at making nice looking front pages. One methodology to accomplish this will be to make many different web pages over a short time. By making a new page every other day, I can challenge my knowledge that I find lacking.
